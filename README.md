This is my first mini-application created in JavaScript. I'm taking part in infoShare Academy Front-End Developer course at this moment and my coding skills, day by day, grow gradually. This app was a little challenge for me. For the first time I had the opportunity for enjoying with Object-Oriented-Programming on my own. It's require thinking, but this is very cool! In short, this is my first step in real coding. The road is starting now :)

The app is very simple. You can:
- add tasks (if page reloads, list with your tasks are saved -> I used localStorage)
- deleting them
- mark as resolved by clicking on it
- filtering by finished and not-finished.

Enjoy :)
